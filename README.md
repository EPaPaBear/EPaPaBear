# Johnson Martin

So basically I'm a software engineer, predominantly backend-oriented with the occasional frontend endeavour when the situation necessitates such undertakings, which is more often than I'd like to admit if I'm being entirely honest with myself here.

## The Whole Shebang

I do a lot of Java Spring Boot and FastAPI work, and by "a lot" I mean that's essentially been my bread and butter for a considerable amount of time now, alongside React for when things need to have, you know, actual interfaces that humans interact with. Recently I've been knee-deep in automated web platform reverse-engineering. Think login flows, HAR analysis, understanding authentication patterns, spoofing browser requests, that whole rabbit hole.

## The Long Game

Computer Graphics and Vision is where I'm trying to eventually end up, career-wise, life-wise, existence-wise. I've got some [VR stuff](https://github.com/EPaPaBear/VR-Room-EPapaBear), an [Arduino door lock thing with OpenCV](https://github.com/EPaPaBear/Arduino_DoorLock_OpenCV) that I'm genuinely proud of, and various other experimentations in that domain. Still very much in the "figuring it out" phase but the destination is clear even if the path is... meandering.

## Repos of Note
- [fastapi_auth_wrapper](https://github.com/EPaPaBear/fastapi_auth_wrapper) — authentication wrapper because writing the same boilerplate repeatedly is not the vibe
- [flood-tracker](https://github.com/EPaPaBear/flood-tracker-v1) — exactly what it sounds like
- [AttendEase](https://github.com/EPaPaBear/AttendEase) — geolocation attendance system, very useful, very practical
- [voter-registration-system](https://github.com/EPaPaBear/voter-registration-system) — from the Java console app era

## Available for Hire
Freelancing at the moment. Backend, frontend, the occasional "can you figure out why this authentication isn't working" situation. You know how to reach me.
